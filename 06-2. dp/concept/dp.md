## DP

### Top-Down Approach (Memoization)

- break down main problem into sub-problems
- recursion with memoization (=recursive DP)

### Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)

- start with the smallest sub-problems first and build up to the main problem
- iteration (=iterative DP)


### Top-Down vs Bottom-Up

- bottom-up solves all sub-problems in a predetermined order
- top-down solves sub-problems as needed, which can be more space-efficient for some problems
